# Restaurant Data
## Restaurant Data Exercise
<img src="restaurants.png" width='300'/>
This exercise demonstrates the CRUD elements of GraphQL to query and update data (Create, Read, Update, and Delete). 
<br></br>
To run this on your machine you'll need Express and GraphQL. Download the index.js and .json files, open a terminal and type npm install 
express express-graphql graphql --save. Then type node index.js and go to localhost:5500/graphql to be able to interface with GraphQL and submit queries.
<br></br>
Additional functionality that would be helpful to a user for future iterations would be to add a bootstrapped webpage to display the requested data.
